# GMT

Collection for convenient plotting and conversion from the terminal, based on
[GMT](https://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/). Since GMT frequently changes their syntax
the scripts are sorted by version number.

**NOTE:** This collection in particular is pretty basic and I created it when
version 5.4 was the latest. The compatibility of the scripts in the versions
before is not granted. Also, scripts that were written for GMT 5.4 were not
back-ported.
