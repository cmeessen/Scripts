# Scripts

A collection of scripts and other stuff that I used during the course of my doctorate.

This is a loose collection, not maintained and not fully documented.

**Note:** some scripts that require GMT do not work if GMT had been installed via the default repositories because I used short commands, e.g. `mapproject` instead of `gmt mapproject`. If GMT was installed via a repository, `gmt` has to be prepended in front of each command. Otherwise, compiling and installing GMT from source should work as well.
